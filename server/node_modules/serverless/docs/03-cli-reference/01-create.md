## Examples

### Creating a new service

```
serverless create --template aws-nodejs
```

This example will generate scaffolding for a service with `AWS` as a provider and `nodejs` as runtime. The scaffolding
will be generated in the current working directory.

Your new service will have a default stage called `dev` and a default region inside that stage called `us-east-1`.
The provider which is used for deployment later on is AWS (Amazon web services).

### Creating a named service in a (new) directory

```
serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path my-new-service
```

This example will generate scaffolding for a service with `AWS` as a provider and `nodejs` as runtime. The scaffolding
will be generated in the `my-new-service` directory. This directory will be created if not present. Otherwise Serverless
will use the already present directory.

Additionally Serverless will rename the service according to the path you provide. In this example the service will be
renamed to `my-new-service`.
