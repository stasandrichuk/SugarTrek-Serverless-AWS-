# Compile SNS Events

This plugins compiles the function SNS event to a CloudFormation resource.

## How it works

`Compile SNS Events` hooks into the [`deploy:compileEvents`](/lib/plugins/deploy) lifecycle.

It loops over all functions which are defined in `serverless.yml`. For each function that has a SNS event defined,
a corresponding SNS topic will be created.

You have two options to define the SNS event:

The first one is to use a simple string which defines the "Topic name" for SNS. The lambda function will be triggered
every time a message is sent to this topic.

The second option is to define the SNS event more granular (e.g. the "Topic name" and the "Display name") with the help of
key value pairs.

Take a look at the [Event syntax examples](#event-syntax-examples) below to see how you can setup a SNS event.

A corresponding lambda permission resource is created for the SNS event.

Those two resources are then merged into the compiled CloudFormation template.

## Event syntax examples

### Simple SNS setup

This setup specifies that the `forward` function should be run every time a message is sent to the "messages" SNS topic.

```yml
# serverless.yml
functions:
  forward:
    handler: message.forward
    events:
      - sns: messages
```

### SNS setup with extended event options

This configuration sets up a SNS topic with the name "lambda-caller". The "Display name" of the topic is "Used to chain
lambda functions".  The `run` function is executed every time a message is sent to the "lambda-caller" SNS topic.

```yml
# serverless.yml
functions:
  run:
    handler: event.run
    events:
      - sns:
          topicName: lambda-caller
          displayName: Used to chain lambda functions
```

### SNS setup with pre-existing topic ARN
If you already have a topic that you've created manually, you can simply just provide the topic arn instead of the topic name using the `topicArn` property. Here's an example:

```yml
# serverless.yml
functions:
  run:
    handler: event.run
    events:
      - sns:
          topicArn: some:arn:xxx
```

Or as a shortcut you can provide it as a string value to the `sns` key:

```yml
# serverless.yml
functions:
  run:
    handler: event.run
    events:
      - sns: some:arn:xxx
```

The framework will detect that you've provided an ARN and will give permission to SNS to invoke that function. **You need to make sure you subscribe your function to that pre-existing topic manually**, as there's no way to add subscriptions to an existing topic ARN via CloudFormation.
